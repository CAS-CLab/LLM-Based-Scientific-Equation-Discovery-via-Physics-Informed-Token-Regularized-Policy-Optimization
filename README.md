📄 [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10576)

This repository presents the open-source resources associated with the paper **PiT-PO: Physics-informed Token-regularized Policy Optimization for LLM-Based Scientific Equation Discovery**. We release the RL training framework to reproduce the results of the paper.

## 📰 News

- **[2026/05]** Our paper has been accepted by **KDD 2026 AI for Science Track**!
- **[2026/02]** Our paper is now available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10576)!

## Overview

PiT-PO turns a Large Language Model from a *static* equation proposer into an *adaptive* generator that is fine-tuned during the search itself. It combines:

- **In-search GRPO fine-tuning** of the LLM with LoRA, driven by symbolic-regression feedback.
- **Hierarchical physical constraints** (dimensional homogeneity, differentiability, plus domain-specific priors) used as a *gated* reward signal.
- **Token-level redundancy regularization** derived from the **Support Exclusion Theorem**: redundant terms in the fitted equation are identified by the normalized coefficient ratio τᵢ = |bᵢ| / (Σⱼ|bⱼ| + ε) and penalized at the token level.
- A **multi-island evolutionary buffer** that maintains population diversity and periodically reseeds weaker islands.

Empirically, PiT-PO sets new state-of-the-art on the LLM-SR Suite and LLM-SRBench, and discovers a non-linear Reynolds-stress closure for the periodic-hill turbulent flow that out-performs the standard k–ω SST RANS baseline against DNS reference data.

```

## Installation

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pitpo
```

Hardware: experiments run on a single 24 GB GPU (e.g. RTX 3090) using a Llama-3.x backbone. Two GPUs are recommended if you want to host the vLLM inference server and the LoRA fine-tuning process on separate devices.

## Quick start

Launch a full run (vLLM is started automatically by the Python process):

```bash
bash run_experiment.sh <problem> <vLLM_GPU> <GRPO_GPU> <port>
# example:
bash run_experiment.sh oscillator1 0 1 6000
```

Or invoke the Python entry point directly:

```bash
python launch_grpo.py \
    --problem oscillator1 \
    --max_samples 3000 \
    --port 6000 \
    --grpo_lr 1e-6 \
    --grpo_batch_size 4 \
    --buffer_size 100 \
    --grpo_train_every 32 \
    --device_id 0 \
    --vllm_gpu 0
```

Common arguments:

| Flag | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--problem` | task name; must have `specs/specification_<problem>_numpy.txt` and `data/<problem>/train.csv` | `oscillator1` |
| `--max_samples` | total number of LLM-generated equations | `3000` |
| `--grpo_lr` | LoRA fine-tuning learning rate | `1e-6` |
| `--grpo_batch_size` | GRPO group size G | `4` |
| `--grpo_train_every` | trigger one fine-tune step every N valid samples | `64` |
| `--training_strategy` | `conservative` / `adaptive` / `aggressive` / `continuous` | `continuous` |
| `--disable_grpo` | run pure prompt-evolution baseline (no fine-tuning) | off |
| `--vllm_gpu` | physical GPU id used to host the vLLM server | — |
| `--device_id` | GPU id used for LoRA fine-tuning | `0` |

Logs, reward curves, and the merged LoRA weights are written under `logs/`, `reward_curves/`, and `runs/` respectively (one timestamped subfolder per run).

To stop:

```bash
bash stop_experiment.sh                  # stop the most recent run
bash stop_experiment.sh runs/<run_dir>   # stop a specific run
```

## Adding a new task

1. Drop the data under `data/<task>/train.csv` (last column = target) and, optionally, `test_id.csv` / `test_ood.csv`.
2. Add a spec file `specs/specification_<task>_numpy.txt` defining
   - a Python skeleton decorated with `@equation.evolve` (the function to search), and
   - optionally `@evaluate.run` (a custom fitness evaluator; a default least-squares evaluator is injected if missing).
3. Run `bash run_experiment.sh <task> ...`.
